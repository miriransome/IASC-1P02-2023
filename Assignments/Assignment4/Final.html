		<p>Hi and welcome to Unfiltered! My name is Miriam (Miri for short), and this is my ‘blog’. It’s really just a website consisting of some of my favourites – my favourite books, favourite songs, and favourite movies.
			 I’m not sure if that actually qualifies as a blog but luckily this is my page, so I can do whatever I want :) </p>
		<p>Before we get into the nitty gritty of things, here’s some background info about me. Instead of a long blurb, I think it’s more interesting to get to know me with 10 fun facts, so here we go!</p>

		<ol>
			<li>I’m from Trinidad and Tobago (big up the 868).</li>
			<li>My favourite time is 12:34 (because it’s 1,2,3,4 duh).</li>
			<li>My favourite colours are green and pink (Cosmo and Wanda aren't slick).</li>
			<li>I prefer drinking out of mugs as opposed to cups or glasses, and I hope to have an extensive mug collection.</li>
			<li>I can’t snap like a normal person and I’m yet to find someone who snaps like me.</li>
			<li>I have 5 tattoos, one of which is a set of 5 hearts and each heart is hand-drawn by one of my best friends. </li>
			<li>Daylight savings makes no sense to me because who just decided that they were going to change the time on the clocks and why did several other people agree to it???</li>
			<li>This fun little ‘blog’ is actually just an assignment for my web media production class (but you probably already know that because you’re either a friend I’ve explained this to or the person(s) grading this). </li>
			<li>I love nicknames – both nicknaming people and being called by a nickname (but the latter is only true if I consider you a friend; to any enemies reading this please don’t nickname me). </li>
			<li>My favourite flowers are tulips, and I plan to retire from accounting at the age of 33 and open a multi-faceted shop/boutique/whatever with flowers, books, tea, and whatever else I desire. </li>
		</ol>
